# MIT 6.041 Probability

# Sample Space & Probability

## Sets

-   Set operation

## Probabilistic Models

PM consists of:

-   Sample space
-   Probability law

Sequential Models.

### 3 Probability Axioms

1.  Nonnegativity
2.  Additivity
3.  Normalization

Discrete Uniform Probability Law->古典概型。

Continuous Models->几何概型。

P14 textbook, Some Prop. s of Probability Laws.

## Conditional Probability

### Multiplication Rule

## Total Probability Theorem & Bayes’ Rule



## Independence

### Conditional Independence

Def:

1.  $$P(A\cap B|C)=P(A|C)P(B|C)$$
2.  $$P(A|B\cap C)=P(A|C)$$

### Binomial formula

即二项分布，伯努利分布

## Counting

1.  乘法法则
2.  k-permutations->n元素取k元素排列
3.  Combinations
4.  Partitions(Multinomial coefficient)

## Summary

Three methods for calculating probabilities:

1.  Counting. Using Discrete Uniform Probability Law.
2.  Sequential. Using Multiplication rule.
3.  Divide & conquer. Using Total probability theorem.

## Problems
